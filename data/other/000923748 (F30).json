The brush head of the\nProvox Brush consists of Nylon filaments as bristles, twisted metal wire\n(Name: SUS304, diameter: 0.65mm, stainless steel) and a PP-plastic\ntip on top of the brush head. This stainless steel wire has its breaking\npoint at 758 N/mm/\u20182 on average, making it very resilient to mechanical\nforces. It takes repeated damage to the material (such as bending it\nback and forth repeatedly) to weaken and subsequently break the\nmaterial. Furthermore, SUS303 is a medical grade steel used in a\nvariety of medical products (such as implants and surgical tools). As a\nconsequence, this kind of steel has to pass vigorous quality controls.\nThe maximum forces applied to the brush during a cleaning procedure\nare at 13.7N. The chances of dislocating the voice prosthesis while\ncleaning are high when applying more than 13.7N of force.\nTherefore, the customer would have dislocated his VP before applying\nenough force to damage the brush.\n"}
