The event of corrosion was confirmed by inspection of the\ndevice and event of disassociation was confirmed by clinician review.\nMethod & Results:\n-Device evaluation and results: Visual inspection was performed as part of\nthe Material Analysis Report (MAR), which indicated that the devices were\nexamined with the aid of a stereo microscope at magnifications up to 50X.\nBiological material was observed on the porous surfaces of the implant.\nDamage consistent with the loss of taper lock was observed on the stem\ntrunnion. The trunnion was examined further using a scanning electron\nmicroscope (SEM). A material analysis was conducted. The reported\nconcluded that the damage on the returned stem was consistent with loss of\ntaper lock. The EDS analysis showed that the stem was consistent with an\nASTM F1813 alloy. The debris observed on the stem trunnion was consistent\nwith an oxide, a corrosion product, biological material, and the stem base.\nBased on the given information, no identifiable materials or manufacturing\ndiscrepancies were observed on the surfaces examined. Dimensional and\nFunctional analysis were not performed as the device was received in\ndamaged condition.\n-Clinician Review: The available medical records were provided to the\nconsulting clinician for a review which noted that, \" Re PI - 2489040 which\nrepresents a male patient, DOB 6/26/56 described as 68 inches tall and\nweighing 190 pounds.

The left hip has a\nmodular, long stem revision THA reduced. The right hip has an uncemented\nprimary THA with the stem trunnion dislocated and disassociated from the\nmodular head. 1 unlabeled color photo of an explanted, blood-stained femoral\nstem with superior trunnion erosion noted. 4 unlabelled color photos of blood\nstained grossly intact acetabular components including a metal head and\nshell. No clinical or PMH, no operative reports, no dated serial x-rays, no\nexamination of explanted components.
